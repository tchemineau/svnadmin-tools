== Install ScriptHelper system-wide

Copy content of the tarball in a directory (/usr/lib/ScriptHelper/ for example).

Copy the file ScriptHelper.conf in /etc/ and edit it to change the value of
SCRIPT_HELPER_DIRECTORY variable, which has to be set to the path where you
put ScriptHelper (here: /usr/lib/ScriptHelper)

== Use ScriptHelper in a specific project

If you don't want to install ScriptHelper on the system, and only use
ScriptHelper for your script, you have to set the SCRIPT_HELPER_DIRECTORY
variable, before source any files of ScriptHelper.

Here is an example, assumed that you put ScriptHelper in the './lib/'
directory :
  # simple code to show how to use ScriptHelper from a script
  # without install it
  SCRIPT_HELPER_DIRECTORY='./lib'
  
  # load ScriptHelper libraries
  source ${SCRIPT_HELPER_DIRECTORY}/ask.lib.sh
  source ${SCRIPT_HELPER_DIRECTORY}/ask.lib.sh
  
  ASK --yesno "Does it work [Yes] ?" result 'Y'
  MESSAGE "the result is '${result}'"
  
  return 0

This script whill ask "Does it work [Yes] ?" and print your answer :-)
