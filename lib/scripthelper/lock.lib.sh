# This is a bash library helping to exclusive lock a resource
# Important : this library is really simple and doesn't echo any error message
# Global variables ===========================================================
# IMPORTANT: Please to write to those variables
# __LIB_LOCK__ : 'Loaded' when the lib is 'source'd
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # usage: LOCK <file>
  # desc: Lock a <file> for exclusive access. It returns 0 if lock can be made, a non-zero value otherwise
  # note: If the lock already exists, LOCK returns 1
  LOCK () {
    [ -z "${1:-}" ] && return 1
    ln -s "$1" "$1.lock" 2>/dev/null || return 1
    ln -s "$1" "$1.lock.$$"

  # desc: Revoke a lock on <file>. It returns 0 on success, a non-zero value otherwise

  # usage: IS_LOCKED <file>
  # desc: Look if the lock was made by an other process on <file>
  # note: return 0 if <file> is locked, 1 otherwise

  # usage: WAIT_FOR_UNLOCK <file>
  # desc: wait until the lock on <file> is removed
  # note: if an argument is not present, it doesn't wait
  # WARNING: this method can tell that the resource is not locked, whereas it's looked some
  #          CPU ticks later (due to 'method return' time and 'thread context switch' time.
  #          Prefer to use WAIT_AND_LOCK if you want to take a lock
